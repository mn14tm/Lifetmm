  "body": "### Overview.\r\nThis package contains several functions to simulate the electromagnetic field within an optically homogeneous and isotropic multilayered structure. At the moment the package functionality is contained within two classes:\r\n\r\n* The TransferMatrix class calculates the electric or magnetic field within a multilayered structure (and optionally the cladding) for an incoming field at an angle with a given polarisation.\r\n* The LifetimeTmm class builds on the TransferMatrix class to calculate the spontaneous emission rate (or radiative lifetime) of a dipole in a non-absorbing (multilayered) medium.\r\n\r\nI have tried to make the classes easy to use with a bit of error checking so that knowledge of the inner code workings is not required. Please see the examples to get an idea of what can be simulated.\r\n\r\n### TransferMatrix\r\nBla\r\n\r\n### LifetimeTmm\r\nBla\r\n\r\n### Literature and Code References\r\n#### TransferMatrix\r\nThe procedure is adapted from the two references\r\n\r\n> J. Appl. Phys Vol 86, No. 1 (1999) p.487\r\n> JAP 93 No. 7 p. 3693 \r\n\r\nThe code is **heavily** inspired by the code written in 2010 by George F. Burkhard, Eric T. Hoke at Stanford University, which was ported to python in 2012 by Kamil Mielczarek (kamil.m@utdallas.edu) at the University of Texas at Dallas. See http://web.stanford.edu/group/mcgehee/transfermatrix/ for the source code. The code they have written is targeted towards simulating the absorption within solar cells and the reference \r\n\r\n> Accounting for Interference, Scattering, and Electrode Absorption to Make Accurate Internal Quantum Efficiency Measurements in Organic and Other Thin Solar Cells_, G. F. Burkhard, E. T. Hoke, M. D. McGehee, Adv. Mater., 22, 3293 \r\n\r\nshows the type of simulations that can be performed.\r\n\r\nAnother good transfer matrix package, which parts of this code borrows from, is the \"**tmm**\" package by Steven Byrnes (http://sjbyrnes.com), which may be found at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tmm.\r\n\r\n#### LifetimeTmm\r\nThe derivation and implementation of the equations is given in \r\n\r\n> Quantum theory of spontaneous emission in multilayer dielectric structures, Creatore, Celestino and Andreani, Lucio Claudio.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nThis package was created by Thomas Mann (@mn14tm), a PhD researcher at the Faculty of Engineering in the University of Leeds.
