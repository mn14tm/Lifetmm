  "body": "### Overview.\r\nThis package contains several functions to simulate the electromagnetic field within an optically homogeneous and isotropic multilayered structure. At the moment the package functionality is contained within two classes:\r\n\r\n* The TransferMatrix class calculates the electric or magnetic field within a multilayered structure (and optionally the cladding) for an incoming field at an angle with a given polarisation.\r\n* The LifetimeTmm class builds on the TransferMatrix class to calculate the spontaneous emission rate (or radiative lifetime) of a dipole in a non-absorbing (multilayered) medium.\r\n\r\nI have tried to make the classes easy to use with a bit of error checking so that knowledge of the inner code workings is not required. Please see the examples to get an idea of what can be simulated.\r\n\r\n### TransferMatrix\r\nBla\r\n\r\n### LifetimeTmm\r\nBla\r\n\r\n### Literature and Code References\r\n#### TransferMatrix\r\nThe procedure is adapted from J. Appl. Phys Vol 86, No. 1 (1999) p.487 and JAP 93 No. 7 p. 3693. The code is heavily inspired by the code written in 2010 by George F. Burkhard, Eric T. Hoke, [Stanford University] which was ported to python in 2012 by Kamil Mielczarek (kamil.m@utdallas.edu) [University of Texas at Dallas]. See http://web.stanford.edu/group/mcgehee/transfermatrix/ or \"Accounting for Interference, Scattering, and Electrode Absorption to Make Accurate Internal Quantum Efficiency Measurements in Organic and Other Thin Solar Cells\", G. F. Burkhard, E. T. Hoke, M. D. McGehee, Adv. Mater., 22, 3293. for more information.\r\n\r\nAnother good transfer matrix package, which parts of this code borrows from, is the \"tmm\" package by Steven Byrnes (http://sjbyrnes.com), which may be found at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tmm.\r\n\r\n#### LifetimeTmm\r\nThe derivation and implementation of the equations is given in \"Quantum theory of spontaneous emission in multilayer dielectric structures\" by Creatore, Celestino and Andreani, Lucio Claudio.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nThis package was created by Thomas Mann (@mn14tm), a PhD researcher at the Faculty of Engineering in the University of Leeds.
